# Risk Management Multi-Agent System

This project implements a Multi-Agent System for risk management, designed to automate and enhance the risk management process through collaborative, specialized agents.

## System Overview

The system decomposes the risk management workflow into tasks handled by dedicated agents:

- **Risk Coordinator Agent:** Central hub, manages workflow and human interaction.
- **Internal Data Scanner Agent:** Monitors internal data sources for risk signals.
- **External Environment Monitor Agent:** Tracks external PESTLE factors.
- **Market & Industry Analyst Agent:** Analyzes market and industry-specific risks.
- **Quantitative Risk Assessor Agent:** Performs quantitative risk analysis.
- **Qualitative Risk Assessor Agent:** Assesses qualitative risks.
- **Response Strategy Agent:** Suggests risk mitigation strategies.
- **Monitoring & Reporting Agent:** Tracks risks, KRIs, and reports status.
